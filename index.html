				<h2>My <span>Reflection</span></h2>
				<p>What I understand.</p>
				 <div class="reflection-grid">
					<div class="reflection-box">Philosophical Perspective (Reflection)
						<p>Out of all the topics, this one is what I like most.
						I feel like there is so much to learn, to analyze, and to 
						understand. I like the way these philosophers think.</p></div>
					<div class="reflection-box">Physical Self (Reflection)
						<p>This topic made me understand simple things about my physical self that 
						I did not know about. How a face shape, blood type, body type, etc., 
						explains so much about yourself.</p></div>
					<div class="reflection-box">Material Self (Reflection)
						<p>It helped me realize the power of influence. How easy it is to 
						influence someone in the things they buy. How, in reality,
						the things we buy the most are things we don't need.</p></div>
					<div class="reflection-box">Digital Self (Reflection)
						<p>That it is okay to be a FOMO or JOMO type of person.
						Because in reality, what matters is that we enjoy what we do and we are not
						hurting anybody. </p></div>
					<div class="reflection-box">Mental Self (Reflection)
						<p>We are all smart in our own ways. And that we all have our ways on how 
						we process information and that's totally normal.</p></div>

				<h2>My <span>Application</span></h2>
				<p>How will I apply it.</p>
				<div class="application-box">
					Through these insights, I've gotten a better awareness of myself: physically, intellectually, 
					and digitally, and the factors that shape my identity.  Embracing many points of view has improved 
					my critical thinking and empathy, and understanding the importance of mindful choices has helped.  
					Accepting that it's okay to be different sometimes. Moreover , I plan to apply these concepts by 
					becoming more self-aware, deliberate, and real in my growth and interactions with the people around me.
